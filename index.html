                    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
                    <p>JavaScript is a fun one as it is one of my favorites. I am good with working with JavaScript as it is one of the most used coding language and due to that
                        I have learned a lot about it.

                    <p> Python was the first language I learned and the whole reason I found out how much I love to code. With that being said I learned a lot about Python
                        to be able to say that it is one of my Strengths.

                        looking into sub-HTML like TypeScript and React.

                    <br>
                    <p>CSS is a strong one for me as I love to be creative and love to create cool animations as well
